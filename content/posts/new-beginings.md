After contracting with T-Mobile for a year I've accepted a full time opportunity as Principal Architect on January 17th of this year. 
Over past year I learned and grown so much that I had to continue the journey. 

My previous blog [thisdevmind.com](http://www.thisdevmind.com), I wont be posting anything there anymore. This blog is mostly going to be focussed on 
DevOps, AWS Cloud, Docker, Microservices with SpringBoot & GoKit, API Design/Development, Kafka and Cassandra. 

This blog is built using Hugo with content stored in github repository and hosted on github pages. Maybe at some point I will setup 
a publishing process that pushes content out to AWS S3 with Cloudfront for CDN. 

Cheers,
Ram
