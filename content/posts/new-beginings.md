After contracting with T-Mobile for a year I've accepted a full time opportunity as Principal Architect on January 17th of this year. Over past year I learned and grown so much that I had to continue the journey. 

My previous blog [thisdevmind.com](http://www.thisdevmind.com) will be inactive and I wont be posting anything there anymore. This blog will mostly focus on 
DevOps, AWS Cloud, Docker, Microservices with SpringBoot & GoKit, API Design/Development, Kafka and Cassandra. 

This blog is built using Hugo with content stored in github repository and using AWS S3 along with cloudfront for hosting. I must say its costing me way less money monthly and better performance. I'm also using Travisci builds to automatically publish generated site contents to S3. 

Cheers,
Ram
