*PROFESSIONAL*
* * *

My name is Ram Gopinathan and I am Principal Architect with T-Mobile where I focus primarily on AWS cloud, Docker, Mesos/Marathon, Linux and 
Microservices using Java and SpringBoot as well as Vertx and other frameworks. 

Prior to starting with T-Mobile in Jan of 2016 I was focused on Azure Cloud, SharePoint and .NET and spent almost 10 years helping customers 
design, deploy and manage SharePoint farms, along with developing applications on top of SharePoint platform. In 2008 I was fortunate 
to attend R2 rotation of MCM (SharePoint) program and became first few to achieve the certification, although the program is no longer 
active, I definitely consider it as one of the highest points of my professional career.

*PERSONAL*
* * *

I live in Redmond, WA, married with two kids. I've moved around a lot through out my life, in the 90's moved to the States (East Coast), 
in 2001 we moved to Chicago mainly to be closer to wife's family and in 2012 we moved to Redmond, WA, although we are very far from our 
family, we absolutely love it here. We love how green the entire state of Washington is and adore the natural beauty it has to offer. 
Hopefully this is it, no more moving ðŸ™‚

Cheers,
Ram
